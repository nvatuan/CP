## My competitive programming directories
This contains my solutions (solved and unsolved) for public online judges (codeforces, atcoder, topcoder, uva..), some are localized (freecontest, bkdnoj,..). There are some private problems that I haven't asked for permissions but I don't think anyone would access my repo for any reason.
